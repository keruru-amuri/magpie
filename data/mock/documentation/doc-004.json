      "content": "This Service Bulletin applies to all Boeing 737-800 aircraft with Parker Hannifin PV3-300 hydraulic pumps (P/N: HYD-PUMP-001) installed, with serial numbers in the range of SN10001 through SN12500.\n\nNOTE: Pumps with serial numbers SN12501 and higher incorporate the improved pressure compensator design and are not affected by this Service Bulletin.\n\nAffected Component:\n- Part Number: HYD-PUMP-001\n- Serial Number Range: SN10001 through SN12500\n- Name: Hydraulic Pump, Engine-Driven\n- Manufacturer: Parker Hannifin Corporation\n\nCross-reference: For detailed component information, refer to the Hydraulic Pump Component Maintenance Manual (doc-002)."

      "content": "Parker Hannifin has reported instances of premature wear on the pressure compensator spool in certain PV3-300 hydraulic pumps. This wear can result in the following issues:\n\n1. Erratic system pressure fluctuations\n2. Reduced pump efficiency\n3. Increased case drain flow\n4. Potential overheating of the hydraulic system\n5. In extreme cases, inability to maintain required system pressure\n\nThe root cause has been identified as insufficient hardening of the compensator spool surface in pumps manufactured between January 2024 and March 2025 (serial numbers SN10001 through SN12500). Parker Hannifin has implemented an improved manufacturing process for the pressure compensator spool in all pumps with serial numbers SN12501 and higher.\n\nOperators have reported the following symptoms that may indicate a worn pressure compensator spool:\n- Fluctuating hydraulic system pressure indications\n- Slow or erratic operation of hydraulic-powered components\n- Increased hydraulic fluid temperature\n- Increased case drain flow during routine maintenance checks\n\nWARNING: If left unaddressed, a severely worn pressure compensator spool could potentially result in loss of hydraulic system pressure, affecting flight control systems powered by the affected hydraulic system."

      "title": "Corrective Action",
      "content": "The following actions are required:\n\n4.1 INSPECTION\n\nPerform a functional check of the hydraulic pump pressure compensator as follows:\n\n1. Connect hydraulic test equipment to the aircraft hydraulic test ports\n2. Operate the hydraulic system at normal pressure (3,000 psi / 20,684 kPa)\n3. Monitor system pressure for 5 minutes\n4. Cycle hydraulic demand by operating flight controls through full range of motion\n5. Monitor case drain flow\n\nAcceptance Criteria:\n- System pressure must remain within 2,850-3,150 psi (19,650-21,718 kPa)\n- Pressure fluctuations must not exceed ±150 psi (±1,034 kPa)\n- Case drain flow must not exceed 1.5 gallons per minute (5.7 liters per minute)\n\n4.2 REPLACEMENT\n\nIf the pump fails the functional check, or if the pump is within the affected serial number range and has accumulated more than 2,000 flight hours since new or overhaul, replace the pressure compensator assembly as follows:\n\nWARNING: Ensure all hydraulic pressure is relieved before performing maintenance on the pump. Failure to do so may result in personal injury or equipment damage.\n\nTools Required:\n- Standard mechanic's tool set\n- Torque wrench (0-25 ft-lb / 0-34 Nm)\n- New pressure compensator assembly (P/N: HYD-COMP-002)\n- New O-rings and backup rings (P/N: HYD-SEAL-KIT-001)\n\nProcedure:\n1. Gain access to the hydraulic pump on the engine\n2. Depressurize the hydraulic system\n3. Clean the area around the pressure compensator\n4. Remove the four bolts securing the compensator to the pump housing\n5. Carefully remove the compensator assembly\n6. Inspect the compensator bore in the pump housing for damage\n7. Install new O-rings and backup rings on the new compensator assembly\n8. Install the new compensator assembly\n9. Torque the four mounting bolts to 18-20 ft-lb (24-27 Nm) in a diagonal pattern\n10. Perform the functional check described in Section 4.1\n\nRefer to the Hydraulic Pump Component Maintenance Manual (doc-002) for detailed disassembly and assembly procedures."
