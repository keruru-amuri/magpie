      "content": "The Airbus A320 electrical system consists of the following main components:\n\n1. AC Power Generation System\n   - Two engine-driven generators (115V AC, 400Hz, 90 kVA each)\n   - One Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) generator (115V AC, 400Hz, 90 kVA)\n   - One external power connection (115V AC, 400Hz, 90 kVA)\n\n2. AC Power Distribution System\n   - AC Bus 1 and AC Bus 2 (primary distribution buses)\n   - AC Essential Bus (supplies essential equipment)\n   - AC Emergency Bus (supplies emergency equipment)\n\n3. DC Power Generation System\n   - Three Transformer Rectifier Units (TRUs) converting 115V AC to 28V DC\n   - Battery 1 and Battery 2 (24V DC, 23 Ah each)\n\n4. DC Power Distribution System\n   - DC Bus 1 and DC Bus 2 (primary DC distribution buses)\n   - DC Essential Bus (supplies essential DC equipment)\n   - DC Emergency Bus (supplies emergency DC equipment)\n   - Hot Battery Bus (directly connected to Battery 1)\n\n5. Static Inverter\n   - Converts 28V DC to 115V AC, 400Hz for the AC Emergency Bus when normal AC power is not available\n\nThe electrical system is designed with multiple redundancies to ensure continued operation in case of component failures. The system is controlled and monitored by two Electrical Power Control Units (EPCUs) that automatically manage power generation, distribution, and load shedding.\n\nCross-reference: For detailed component information, refer to the Illustrated Parts Catalog."

      "content": "4.1 BATTERY REMOVAL AND INSTALLATION\n\nWARNING: Batteries contain corrosive electrolyte and can produce explosive gases. Wear appropriate PPE including eye protection and acid-resistant gloves.\n\nTools Required:\n- Standard mechanic's tool set\n- Digital multimeter\n- Torque wrench (0-20 Nm)\n\nRemoval Procedure:\n1. Ensure all aircraft electrical power is OFF\n2. Access the battery compartment in the avionics bay\n3. Disconnect the battery temperature sensor connector\n4. Disconnect the negative (-) battery terminal first, then the positive (+) terminal\n5. Remove the battery hold-down clamps\n6. Remove the battery from the aircraft using the built-in carrying handle\n\nInstallation Procedure:\n1. Inspect the battery compartment for cleanliness and damage\n2. Place the battery in the battery compartment\n3. Install and secure the battery hold-down clamps\n4. Connect the positive (+) battery terminal first, then the negative (-) terminal\n5. Torque the battery terminal nuts to 10-12 Nm\n6. Connect the battery temperature sensor connector\n7. Perform the battery capacity check as described in Section 4.2\n\n4.2 BATTERY CAPACITY CHECK\n\nTools Required:\n- Battery capacity tester (P/N: BATT-TEST-001)\n- Digital multimeter\n\nProcedure:\n1. Ensure the battery is fully charged (minimum 24V under no load)\n2. Connect the battery capacity tester to the battery\n3. Set the tester for a 1-hour discharge test at the 1C rate (23A)\n4. Start the test and monitor the battery voltage\n5. Record the battery voltage every 10 minutes\n6. The test is complete when either:\n   a. The 1-hour test period has elapsed, or\n   b. The battery voltage drops below 20V\n\nAcceptance Criteria:\n- The battery must maintain a voltage above 20V for at least 45 minutes\n- The final capacity must be at least 80% of the rated capacity (18.4 Ah)\n\nIf the battery fails the capacity check, it must be replaced.\n\n4.3 GENERATOR BRUSH INSPECTION\n\nCAUTION: Ensure the engine or APU is shut down and cannot be started during this procedure.\n\nTools Required:\n- Inspection mirror\n- Flashlight\n- Brush wear gauge (P/N: GEN-GAUGE-001)\n- Vacuum cleaner with non-metallic nozzle\n\nProcedure:\n1. Access the generator through the appropriate access panel\n2. Remove the brush inspection cover\n3. Use the flashlight and mirror to inspect the brushes for wear, chipping, or abnormal wear patterns\n4. Use the brush wear gauge to measure the length of each brush\n5. Vacuum any carbon dust from the brush area\n6. Inspect the slip rings for scoring, pitting, or discoloration\n7. Reinstall the brush inspection cover\n\nAcceptance Criteria:\n- Minimum brush length: 12 mm\n- No chipping or abnormal wear patterns\n- Slip rings must be clean and free of significant scoring or pitting\n\nIf any brush is worn beyond limits or damaged, replace the brush set according to the procedure in the Component Maintenance Manual."
