      "content": "ElectroSwitch Inc. has reported instances of contact welding in certain BAT-CONT-001 battery contactors. This condition can result in the following issues:\n\n1. Inability to disconnect the battery from the aircraft electrical system\n2. Overheating of the contactor during operation\n3. Potential electrical arcing during attempted disconnection\n4. In extreme cases, risk of electrical fire\n\nThe root cause has been identified as insufficient silver content in the contact material used in contactors manufactured between January 2024 and June 2024 (date codes 2024-01 through 2024-06). ElectroSwitch has implemented an improved contact material with higher silver content in all contactors with date codes 2024-07 and later.\n\nOperators have reported the following symptoms that may indicate a defective contactor:\n- Battery remains connected to the system when the battery switch is turned OFF\n- Abnormal heating of the contactor housing during operation\n- Discoloration or heat damage to the contactor housing\n- Erratic battery disconnect operation\n\nWARNING: If left unaddressed, a welded battery contactor could prevent disconnection of the battery during an electrical emergency or maintenance, potentially resulting in electrical arcing, damage to equipment, or fire."

      "title": "Corrective Action",
      "content": "The following actions are required:\n\n4.1 INSPECTION\n\nPerform a functional check of the battery contactor as follows:\n\n1. Access the battery compartment in the avionics bay\n2. Connect a digital multimeter set to the resistance (ohms) function across the main terminals of the battery contactor\n3. With the Battery Master Switch in the ON position, verify continuity across the contactor (resistance less than 0.01 ohms)\n4. Turn the Battery Master Switch to the OFF position\n5. Verify that the contactor opens (resistance greater than 1 megohm)\n6. Repeat steps 3-5 three times\n\nIn addition, inspect the contactor for the following:\n1. Check the date code on the contactor label\n2. Inspect the contactor housing for discoloration or heat damage\n3. Check for any signs of electrical arcing or burning\n\n4.2 REPLACEMENT\n\nIf the contactor fails the functional check, or if the contactor has a date code between 2024-01 and 2024-06, replace the contactor as follows:\n\nWARNING: Ensure all aircraft electrical power is OFF and the battery is disconnected before replacing the contactor. Failure to do so may result in personal injury or equipment damage.\n\nTools Required:\n- Standard mechanic's tool set\n- Torque wrench (0-20 Nm)\n- New battery contactor (P/N: BAT-CONT-002)\n- Heat shrink tubing assortment\n- Crimping tool for electrical terminals\n\nProcedure:\n1. Disconnect and remove the aircraft battery\n2. Tag and disconnect all wires from the contactor, noting their positions\n3. Remove the mounting bolts securing the contactor to the battery compartment\n4. Remove the contactor from the aircraft\n5. Install the new contactor (P/N: BAT-CONT-002) in the same position\n6. Secure the contactor with the mounting bolts and torque to 8-10 Nm\n7. Reconnect all wires to their original positions on the contactor\n8. Reinstall the aircraft battery\n9. Perform the functional check described in Section 4.1\n\nRefer to the Airbus A320 Aircraft Maintenance Manual (doc-006) for detailed battery removal and installation procedures."
