      "title": "Pump Description and Operation",
      "content": "3.1 GENERAL DESCRIPTION\n\nThe Parker Hannifin PV3-300 hydraulic pump is a variable displacement, pressure-compensated axial piston pump. The pump consists of the following major components:\n\n- Housing assembly\n- Rotating group (cylinder block, pistons, and valve plate)\n- Swashplate assembly\n- Pressure compensator\n- Drive shaft and bearings\n- Case drain\n\n3.2 PRINCIPLES OF OPERATION\n\nThe pump is driven by the aircraft engine accessory gearbox through a splined drive shaft. As the cylinder block rotates, the pistons reciprocate due to their contact with the angled swashplate. During the outward stroke, hydraulic fluid is drawn into the cylinder bores through the valve plate. During the inward stroke, the fluid is pressurized and discharged through the valve plate to the pressure port.\n\nThe pressure compensator automatically adjusts the swashplate angle to maintain the desired output pressure (3,000 psi / 20,684 kPa). When system pressure reaches the compensator setting, the swashplate angle is reduced, decreasing the pump's displacement and flow rate. This variable displacement feature allows the pump to deliver only the flow required by the system, reducing power consumption and heat generation.\n\n3.3 SPECIFICATIONS\n\n- Maximum Operating Pressure: 3,500 psi (24,132 kPa)\n- Nominal Operating Pressure: 3,000 psi (20,684 kPa)\n- Maximum Flow Rate: 30 gallons per minute (114 liters per minute)\n- Operating Temperature Range: -40°F to +275°F (-40°C to +135°C)\n- Weight: 18.5 pounds (8.4 kg)\n- Mounting: SAE 4-bolt flange\n- Drive Shaft: Splined per SAE J744 standard\n\nCross-reference: For detailed parts information, refer to the Illustrated Parts Catalog (doc-003)."

Remove the four mounting bolts securing the pump to the accessory gearbox\n6. Carefully remove the pump from the engine\n7. Cap all openings to prevent contamination\n\nInstallation Procedure:\n1. Ensure the mounting surface on the accessory gearbox is clean and free of debris\n2. Verify the drive splines are undamaged and properly lubricated\n3. Align the pump drive splines with the gearbox drive and carefully install the pump\n4. Install the four mounting bolts and torque to 35-40 ft-lb (47-54 Nm)\n5. Remove the protective caps and connect the pressure and suction lines\n6. Torque the hydraulic fittings according to the aircraft maintenance manual\n7. Connect the electrical connector to the pressure switch\n8. Perform a leak check and functional test as described in Section 4.4\n\n4.2 DISASSEMBLY\n\nCAUTION: Disassembly should only be performed by properly trained personnel in a clean environment.\n\nTools Required:\n- Special disassembly fixture (P/N: HYD-TOOL-101)\n- Bearing puller set\n- Snap ring pliers\n- Soft-faced hammer\n\nProcedure:\n1. Drain all hydraulic fluid from the pump\n2. Mount the pump in the disassembly fixture\n3. Remove the pressure compensator assembly\n4.
