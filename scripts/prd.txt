# MAGPIE: MAG Platform for Intelligent Execution

## Product Overview
MAGPIE is a multiagent LLM platform designed for aircraft MRO (Maintenance, Repair, and Overhaul) organizations to augment their work with AI capabilities. The platform leverages Azure OpenAI API with GPT-4.1 and other models to provide intelligent assistance for maintenance technicians, engineers, and managers.

## Target Users
- Aircraft maintenance technicians
- MRO engineers
- Quality assurance personnel
- Maintenance planners
- MRO management

## Key Features and Requirements

### Core Platform Infrastructure
1. Develop a FastAPI backend with proper project structure
2. Implement Azure OpenAI API integration with model selection capabilities
3. Create a centralized orchestrator for routing requests to appropriate agents
4. Implement context management for maintaining conversation history
5. Develop a model selection system to optimize for cost and capability
6. Create a monitoring and logging system for tracking usage and performance
7. Implement authentication and authorization

### Technical Documentation Assistant
1. Develop an agent for processing and querying technical documentation
2. Create mock aircraft maintenance manuals, service bulletins, and regulatory documents
3. Implement natural language querying capabilities
4. Develop document summarization functionality
5. Implement cross-referencing between different documents
6. Create a system for highlighting critical safety information

### Troubleshooting Advisor
1. Develop an agent for diagnosing and resolving aircraft system issues
2. Create a mock database of common aircraft system faults
3. Implement symptom analysis and cause identification
4. Develop step-by-step troubleshooting guidance
5. Create a system for integrating with maintenance history
6. Implement solution recommendation with parts and tools required

### Maintenance Procedure Generator
1. Develop an agent for creating customized maintenance procedures
2. Create mock templates for standard maintenance tasks
3. Implement customization based on aircraft configuration
4. Develop incorporation of regulatory requirements
5. Create a system for identifying required tools, parts, and equipment
6. Implement safety precaution and warning inclusion

### Testing and Validation
1. Develop comprehensive test cases for each agent
2. Implement integration tests for the orchestrator
3. Create performance benchmarks for different model sizes
4. Develop a system for evaluating response quality
5. Implement user feedback collection for continuous improvement

## Technical Requirements
- Python 3.10+ for backend development
- FastAPI for API development
- PostgreSQL with Supabase for data storage
- Redis for caching
- Docker for containerization
- Azure OpenAI API for LLM capabilities
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD

## Constraints
- Focus on backend development initially, with frontend to be developed later
- Use mock data for initial development and testing
- Optimize for cost by using appropriate model sizes for different tasks
- Ensure compliance with aviation industry standards and regulations

## Success Metrics
- Successful routing of requests to appropriate agents
- Accurate model selection based on task complexity
- High-quality responses from each specialized agent
- Efficient use of context window
- Optimal balance of cost and capability

## Timeline
- Phase 1: Core infrastructure development (4 weeks)
- Phase 2: Agent development and integration (6 weeks)
- Phase 3: Testing and optimization (4 weeks)
- Phase 4: Documentation and handoff (2 weeks)

## Future Considerations
- Integration with actual MRO systems
- Development of a user-friendly frontend
- Expansion to additional specialized agents
- Implementation of ML-based model selection
- Mobile client applications
