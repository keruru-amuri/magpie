# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Mock Aircraft System Fault Database [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design and implement a structured database of common aircraft system faults with associated symptoms, causes, and resolution steps
### Details:
Implementation details:
1. Define a comprehensive data schema for fault records including: fault ID, affected system/component, symptoms, potential causes, troubleshooting steps, required parts/tools, and safety precautions
2. Populate the database with at least 50 common aircraft system faults across different systems (electrical, hydraulic, avionics, engines, etc.)
3. For each fault, include multiple possible symptoms, causes, and detailed resolution steps
4. Store the database in a suitable format (JSON, SQL, etc.) that can be easily queried
5. Implement basic CRUD operations for the database
6. Create utility functions to query faults by system, symptom, or component
7. Testing approach: Verify database integrity with unit tests that validate the schema and query functionality

## 2. Implement Symptom Analysis and Cause Identification Logic [done]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Develop algorithms to analyze reported symptoms and identify potential causes based on the fault database
### Details:
Implementation details:
1. Create a symptom classification system that categorizes symptoms by system and severity
2. Implement a pattern matching algorithm that correlates reported symptoms with known fault patterns
3. Develop a probability-based ranking system for potential causes based on symptom matching
4. Create a fault diagnosis engine that can process multiple symptoms simultaneously
5. Implement confidence scoring for each potential cause identification
6. Build a query interface that accepts symptom descriptions and returns ranked potential causes
7. Develop filtering mechanisms based on aircraft type, component age, and environmental factors
8. Testing approach: Create test cases with various symptom combinations and verify that the system correctly identifies known causes from the database

## 3. Develop Diagnostic Decision Trees and Troubleshooting Guidance Generator [done]
### Dependencies: 10.1, 10.2
### Description: Create a system that generates step-by-step troubleshooting procedures using decision trees based on identified potential causes
### Details:
Implementation details:
1. Design a decision tree data structure for representing troubleshooting workflows
2. Implement algorithms to traverse decision trees based on diagnostic inputs
3. Create a troubleshooting step generator that produces clear, sequential instructions
4. Develop conditional logic handling for branching troubleshooting paths
5. Implement safety precaution integration that automatically includes relevant warnings at appropriate steps
6. Create a mechanism to estimate time and complexity for each troubleshooting path
7. Build a formatting system that presents troubleshooting steps in a clear, consistent format
8. Testing approach: Validate generated troubleshooting sequences against predefined expected outcomes for various fault scenarios

## 4. Create Maintenance History Integration System [done]
### Dependencies: 10.2
### Description: Develop functionality to incorporate aircraft maintenance history into the troubleshooting process for more accurate diagnostics
### Details:
Implementation details:
1. Create a mock maintenance history database schema with records of past issues, repairs, and component replacements
2. Implement an integration layer that can query and analyze maintenance history data
3. Develop algorithms that factor in recurring issues and recent repairs when ranking potential causes
4. Create a component reliability analyzer that considers component age and failure patterns
5. Implement a system to flag components that have exceeded recommended service intervals
6. Build correlation detection between maintenance events and subsequent failures
7. Develop a reporting mechanism that highlights relevant maintenance history during troubleshooting
8. Testing approach: Test with mock maintenance histories to verify the system correctly adjusts diagnostic probabilities based on historical patterns

## 5. Implement Solution Recommendation with Parts and Tools Required [done]
### Dependencies: 10.1, 10.3, 10.4
### Description: Create a system that generates comprehensive solution recommendations including required parts, tools, estimated time, and procedures
### Details:
Implementation details:
1. Develop a solution template system with standardized formats for different types of repairs
2. Create a parts inventory database with part numbers, descriptions, and compatibility information
3. Implement a tools requirement analyzer that identifies necessary tools for each repair procedure
4. Build an estimation engine for repair time based on procedure complexity and required steps
5. Develop a parts substitution system that can recommend alternative parts when exact matches are unavailable
6. Implement a documentation generator that creates printable/exportable repair instructions
7. Create a validation system that ensures all safety procedures and requirements are included in recommendations
8. Testing approach: Verify that generated solution recommendations include all necessary parts, tools, and steps by comparing against predefined benchmark solutions for common issues
