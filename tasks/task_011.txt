# Task ID: 11
# Title: Develop Maintenance Procedure Generator agent
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 5, 6, 17
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a specialized agent for generating customized maintenance procedures based on aircraft configuration and regulatory requirements.
# Details:
Create mock templates for standard maintenance tasks. Implement customization based on aircraft configuration. Develop incorporation of regulatory requirements. Create a system for identifying required tools, parts, and equipment. Implement safety precaution and warning inclusion. Develop step sequencing logic. Create procedure validation against regulations. Implement procedure versioning and change tracking.

# Test Strategy:
Test procedure generation accuracy. Verify regulatory compliance of generated procedures. Test customization based on different aircraft configurations. Validate tool and part recommendations. Measure procedure generation time.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Mock Maintenance Procedure Templates [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop a library of standardized maintenance procedure templates that will serve as the foundation for customized procedures
### Details:
Implementation details:
1. Identify common maintenance tasks across different aircraft types (e.g., engine inspection, landing gear service, avionics checks)
2. Design a template structure with sections for task overview, required qualifications, tools/parts, safety precautions, step-by-step instructions, and sign-off requirements
3. Create 5-10 mock templates covering diverse maintenance scenarios using a standardized format
4. Implement template storage using a database or structured file system
5. Develop a template retrieval API with filtering capabilities

Testing approach:
- Validate template structure against industry standards
- Verify template retrieval functionality with different search parameters
- Review templates with subject matter experts for accuracy and completeness

## 2. Implement Aircraft Configuration Customization [done]
### Dependencies: 11.1
### Description: Develop functionality to customize maintenance procedures based on specific aircraft configurations, models, and modifications
### Details:
Implementation details:
1. Design a data model to represent aircraft configurations (model, series, modifications, installed equipment)
2. Create configuration profiles for common aircraft types
3. Develop logic to identify configuration-specific maintenance requirements
4. Implement a template modification engine that adjusts procedure steps based on configuration parameters
5. Create a mapping system between configuration elements and their maintenance implications

Testing approach:
- Test with multiple aircraft configurations to ensure appropriate customization
- Verify that conflicting configurations are handled properly
- Validate that all configuration-dependent steps are correctly included/excluded
- Perform regression testing to ensure base templates remain intact

## 3. Develop Regulatory Requirement Integration [done]
### Dependencies: 11.1, 11.2
### Description: Create a system to incorporate relevant regulatory requirements into maintenance procedures based on jurisdiction and aircraft type
### Details:
Implementation details:
1. Build a database of regulatory requirements from major aviation authorities (FAA, EASA, etc.)
2. Develop a tagging system to associate regulations with specific maintenance tasks
3. Implement logic to identify applicable regulations based on aircraft type, operation category, and jurisdiction
4. Create a mechanism to inject regulatory citations and compliance statements into procedures
5. Develop validation logic to ensure procedures meet all applicable regulatory requirements

Testing approach:
- Verify correct regulatory citations are included for different jurisdictions
- Test with changing regulatory requirements to ensure updates propagate correctly
- Validate compliance checking functionality with known compliant and non-compliant scenarios
- Review with regulatory experts to confirm accuracy

## 4. Create Tools, Parts, and Equipment Identification System [done]
### Dependencies: 11.1, 11.2
### Description: Develop functionality to identify and list all required tools, parts, and equipment needed for maintenance procedures
### Details:
Implementation details:
1. Create a comprehensive database of maintenance tools, parts, and equipment with unique identifiers
2. Implement natural language processing to extract tool/part requirements from procedure steps
3. Develop logic to associate specific aircraft configurations with required specialized tools
4. Create a system to generate consolidated lists of required items for complete procedures
5. Implement inventory integration capabilities to check availability of required items

Testing approach:
- Verify correct identification of tools and parts from procedure text
- Test with various aircraft configurations to ensure specialized equipment is correctly identified
- Validate the consolidated lists against expert-created lists for accuracy
- Test inventory integration with mock inventory systems

## 5. Implement Safety Precaution and Warning Inclusion [done]
### Dependencies: 11.1, 11.2, 11.3, 11.4
### Description: Develop a system to automatically include relevant safety precautions, warnings, and cautions in generated maintenance procedures
### Details:
Implementation details:
1. Create a database of safety precautions, warnings, and cautions categorized by maintenance type, systems affected, and hazard level
2. Develop logic to identify required safety notices based on procedure steps and aircraft systems involved
3. Implement positioning rules to place warnings appropriately before relevant procedure steps
4. Create a system to highlight critical safety information with appropriate formatting and iconography
5. Develop validation logic to ensure no hazardous procedure lacks appropriate safety warnings

Testing approach:
- Verify appropriate safety warnings are included for hazardous procedures
- Test with various procedure types to ensure relevant precautions are included
- Validate formatting and prominence of critical safety information
- Review with safety experts to confirm comprehensiveness of warnings
- Test the system with intentionally hazardous procedures to ensure warnings are never omitted

## 6. Integrate with Mock Data Infrastructure [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Ensure the Maintenance Procedure Generator agent properly integrates with the mock data infrastructure
### Details:
Implementation details:
1. Connect to the mock data infrastructure API endpoints to access required data
2. Implement data fetching and caching mechanisms for aircraft configurations and regulatory requirements
3. Ensure the agent can handle mock data formats and structures
4. Create adaptors if necessary to transform mock data into formats required by the procedure generator
5. Develop error handling for scenarios where mock data is unavailable or incomplete

Testing approach:
- Verify successful data retrieval from mock infrastructure
- Test with various mock data scenarios including edge cases
- Validate error handling and fallback mechanisms
- Measure performance impacts of data retrieval operations
- Ensure all agent functionality works correctly with mock data sources
