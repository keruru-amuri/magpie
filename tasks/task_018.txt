# Task ID: 18
# Title: Implement End-to-End Tests for Context Management and Agent Components
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop comprehensive end-to-end tests to verify that the context management system and agent components function correctly together, ensuring seamless workflows from context handling to agent responses.
# Details:
Design and implement automated end-to-end test cases that simulate real user interactions with the system, covering critical workflows from context creation and management through to agent response generation. Identify and document key user scenarios, including edge cases and error handling, to ensure robust coverage. Set up a dedicated test environment that mirrors production as closely as possible, including necessary data, configurations, and dependencies. Utilize appropriate E2E testing frameworks (such as Cypress, Playwright, or Selenium) to automate the tests, and ensure tests are maintainable and reliable. Collaborate with developers and QA to define expected outcomes and acceptance criteria for each workflow. Integrate these tests into the CI/CD pipeline to enable automated regression testing and early detection of system-wide issues.

# Test Strategy:
Verify completion by ensuring all critical user workflows involving context management and agent components are covered by automated E2E tests. Each test should validate the full flow from context input to agent output, including handling of invalid or unexpected inputs. Confirm that tests pass consistently in the test environment and are integrated into the CI/CD pipeline. Review test coverage reports to ensure all major scenarios are addressed, and conduct peer reviews of test cases for completeness and accuracy. Validate that failures are actionable and provide clear diagnostics for troubleshooting.

## 3. Implement agent-context integration end-to-end tests [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create comprehensive end-to-end tests for the integration between agent components and the context management system, including conversation flow, agent switching, multi-agent collaboration, and error handling.
### Details:


## 4. Implement test utilities and fixtures [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create reusable test utilities and fixtures for end-to-end tests, including functions for creating test conversations, adding messages, managing context, and simulating agent interactions.
### Details:


## 5. Update CI/CD configuration for end-to-end tests [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Update the CI/CD configuration to include end-to-end tests in the testing pipeline, ensuring they run separately from unit and integration tests and properly report coverage.
