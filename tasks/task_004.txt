# Task ID: 4
# Title: Develop Azure OpenAI API integration
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a service for interacting with Azure OpenAI API, supporting multiple models and handling API responses and errors.
# Details:
Implement a client for Azure OpenAI API using the official SDK. Create abstraction layer for different model endpoints (GPT-4.1 and others). Implement retry logic for API failures. Set up proper error handling for rate limits and other API errors. Create a response parsing system. Implement streaming response handling. Add configuration for API keys and endpoints. Create a token counting utility for managing context windows. Implement prompt templating system.

# Test Strategy:
Create comprehensive unit tests for all components with at least 90% test coverage. Implement mock responses for API calls to test both success and failure scenarios. Test error handling with simulated failures, including rate limits, timeouts, and server errors. Verify token counting accuracy across different model types. Test streaming response handling with various payload sizes. Validate prompt template rendering with edge cases. Create integration tests with mock API responses. Implement performance tests for response handling under different loads.

3. Add support for chat completion requests with proper message formatting
4. Implement streaming response handling with proper event processing
5. Create response object models to standardize API returns
6. Add request parameter validation before sending to API

Testing approach:
- Unit tests with mocked API responses for all request types (aim for 90% coverage)
- Create comprehensive mock response library simulating various API returns
- Integration tests for basic completion requests using mock API
- Tests for streaming response processing with different chunk sizes
- Performance tests for response handling with large payloads
- Test malformed responses and edge cases

## 4. Implement error handling and retry logic [done]
### Dependencies: 4.3
### Description: Create a robust error handling system with retry logic for API failures, rate limits, and other common errors.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Create custom exception classes for different API error types
2. Implement exponential backoff retry strategy for transient failures
3. Add specific handling for rate limit errors with appropriate waiting periods
4. Implement circuit breaker pattern to prevent cascading failures
5. Create logging system for API errors with appropriate detail levels
6. Add timeout handling for long-running requests
7. Implement graceful degradation options when API is unavailable

Testing approach:
- Unit tests for retry logic with simulated failures (aim for 90% coverage)
- Mock different error responses from API to test all error handling paths
- Tests for exponential backoff behavior with time simulation
- Tests for different error types and exception handling
- Integration tests with deliberate error conditions
- Performance tests under error conditions and retry scenarios
- Test circuit breaker behavior under sustained failure conditions

## 5. Create response parsing and testing framework [done]
### Dependencies: 4.3, 4.4
### Description: Implement a response parsing system and comprehensive testing framework for the Azure OpenAI integration.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Create response parser classes for different API return types
2. Implement JSON schema validation for API responses
3. Add helper methods for extracting common data patterns from responses
4. Create a mock server for testing that simulates Azure OpenAI API
5. Implement integration test suite covering all API functionality
6. Create performance testing benchmarks for API operations
7. Add documentation generator for API client usage

Testing approach:
- Unit tests for response parsing with sample responses (aim for 90% coverage)
- Develop a comprehensive set of mock responses covering all API return scenarios
- End-to-end tests using the mock server with various response types
- Validation tests for error scenarios and malformed responses
- Documentation tests to ensure examples work as expected
- Integration tests with actual API (using minimal tokens)
- Performance tests with different response sizes and complexities

## 6. Implement test coverage reporting and continuous integration [done]
### Dependencies: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5
### Description: Set up test coverage reporting and integrate tests into the CI pipeline to ensure maintaining at least 90% test coverage.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Configure code coverage tool to track unit test coverage
2. Set up reporting dashboard for test coverage metrics
3. Implement coverage thresholds that fail builds when coverage drops below 90%
4. Create CI pipeline job specifically for running all tests
5. Add performance test benchmarks to detect regressions
6. Implement test report generation for easy review
7. Configure alerting for test failures in CI

Testing approach:
- Verify coverage reporting accuracy
- Test CI pipeline with intentionally reduced coverage to confirm threshold enforcement
- Validate test reports for clarity and completeness
- Ensure all test types (unit, integration, performance) are properly executed in CI
