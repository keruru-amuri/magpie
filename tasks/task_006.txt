## 6. Implement Test Infrastructure for Agent Components [done]
### Dependencies: 3.7
### Description: Extend the test infrastructure to support integration tests for agent components, building on the foundation created for the orchestrator component.
### Details:
This subtask extends the test infrastructure to support integration tests for agent components, building on the foundation created for the orchestrator component.

Tasks to complete:
1. Extend the test configuration module to support agent component testing
2. Create mock implementations of agent-specific dependencies
3. Implement test fixtures for common agent test scenarios
4. Ensure all agent component integration tests pass

Implementation details:
1. Extend the `test_config.py` module with functions for setting up agent-specific test dependencies
2. Create mock implementations for agent-specific external services:
   ```python
   class MockDocumentationService:
       async def search_documents(self, query, filters=None):
           # Return predefined search results for testing
           return [
               {"title": "Test Document 1", "content": "This is test content 1", "relevance": 0.9},
               {"title": "Test Document 2", "content": "This is test content 2", "relevance": 0.8}
           ]
   
   class MockTroubleshootingService:
       async def diagnose_issue(self, symptoms, context=None):
           # Return predefined diagnosis for testing
           return {
               "issue": "Test Issue",
               "confidence": 0.85,
               "recommendations": ["Test Recommendation 1", "Test Recommendation 2"]
           }
   
   class MockMaintenanceService:
       async def generate_procedure(self, task, aircraft_type, context=None):
           # Return predefined procedure for testing
           return {
               "title": "Test Procedure",
               "steps": ["Step 1", "Step 2", "Step 3"],
               "tools_required": ["Tool 1", "Tool 2"]
           }
   ```
3. Create test fixtures for common agent test scenarios:
   ```python
   @pytest.fixture
   def mock_documentation_agent():
       # Create a mock documentation agent for testing
       agent = DocumentationAgent(
           llm_service=MockLLMService(),
           document_service=MockDocumentationService()
       )
       return agent
   
   @pytest.fixture
   def mock_troubleshooting_agent():
       # Create a mock troubleshooting agent for testing
       agent = TroubleshootingAgent(
           llm_service=MockLLMService(),
           troubleshooting_service=MockTroubleshootingService()
       )
       return agent
   
   @pytest.fixture
   def mock_maintenance_agent():
       # Create a mock maintenance agent for testing
       agent = MaintenanceAgent(
           llm_service=MockLLMService(),
           maintenance_service=MockMaintenanceService()
       )
       return agent
   ```
4. Update integration tests to use the mocks and fixtures

This subtask builds on the test infrastructure created for the orchestrator component and extends it to support agent component testing. It will ensure that all agent component integration tests pass and provide a solid foundation for future test infrastructure improvements.

## 7. Implement End-to-End Tests for Context Management and Agent Components [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop comprehensive end-to-end tests to verify that the context management system and agent components function correctly together, ensuring seamless workflows from context handling to agent responses.
### Details:
This subtask focuses on creating comprehensive end-to-end tests that verify the entire system works together correctly, from context management to agent responses.

Tasks to complete:
1. Design test scenarios that cover the full workflow from context creation to agent response
2. Implement automated end-to-end tests for these scenarios
3. Create tests for error handling and edge cases
4. Ensure tests are integrated into the CI/CD pipeline

Implementation details:
1. Create test scenarios that simulate real user interactions:
   - Creating a new conversation and adding messages
   - Retrieving context for an existing conversation
   - Processing context through different agent types
   - Handling context window management during long conversations
   - Testing context summarization and pruning

2. Implement end-to-end tests using pytest:
   ```python
   @pytest.mark.asyncio
   async def test_full_conversation_workflow():
       # Set up test environment
       conversation_repo = ConversationRepository()
       context_service = ContextService()
       agent_factory = AgentFactory()
       
       # Create a new conversation
       conversation = conversation_repo.create(user_id=1, title="Test Conversation")
       
       # Add messages to the conversation
       system_message = conversation_repo.add_message(
           conversation_id=conversation.id,
           role=MessageRole.SYSTEM,
           content="You are a helpful assistant."
       )
       
       user_message = conversation_repo.add_message(
           conversation_id=conversation.id,
           role=MessageRole.USER,
           content="I need information about Boeing 737 maintenance."
       )
       
       # Get context for the conversation
       context = conversation_repo.get_conversation_context(
           conversation_id=conversation.id,
           max_tokens=4000
       )
       
       # Create an agent and process the query
       agent = agent_factory.create_agent(AgentType.DOCUMENTATION)
       result = await agent.process_query(
           query="Tell me about landing gear maintenance",
           conversation_id=conversation.id,
           context={"conversation_history": context}
       )
       
       # Verify the result
       assert "response" in result
       assert "sources" in result
       assert len(result["sources"]) > 0
   ```

3. Create tests for error handling and edge cases:
   - Test with invalid conversation IDs
   - Test with empty context
   - Test with context exceeding token limits
   - Test with malformed messages

4. Ensure tests are integrated into the CI/CD pipeline:
   - Configure pytest to run end-to-end tests separately from unit tests
   - Set up test data fixtures for consistent testing
   - Implement proper cleanup after tests

This subtask will ensure that all components of the context management system and agent components work together correctly, providing a solid foundation for the MAGPIE platform.
