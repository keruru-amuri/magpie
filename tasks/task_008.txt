# Task ID: 8
# Title: Implement monitoring and logging system
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 4, 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a comprehensive system for tracking usage, performance, errors, and other metrics across the platform.
# Details:
Implement structured logging using a library like loguru. Create custom middleware for request/response logging. Develop performance metrics collection for API calls and LLM requests. Implement error tracking and alerting. Create usage dashboards for monitoring. Develop cost tracking for LLM API usage. Implement audit logging for security-relevant events. Create log rotation and archiving. Implement distributed tracing for request flows across services.

# Test Strategy:
Verify log capture for various system events. Test performance metric accuracy. Validate error tracking and alerting. Test audit log completeness. Measure logging system performance impact.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement structured logging with loguru [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up a structured logging system using loguru library to standardize log formats and levels across the application
### Details:
1. Install loguru package and configure it as the main logging system
2. Define standard log format including timestamp, log level, module name, and message
3. Configure different log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL)
4. Create utility functions for common logging patterns
5. Implement log context enrichment to include request IDs and user information
6. Set up log sinks for console output during development and file output in production
7. Test logging across different modules to ensure consistency
8. Document logging standards and patterns for the development team

## 2. Create middleware for request/response logging and performance metrics [done]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Develop middleware components to log API requests/responses and collect performance metrics for all API calls and LLM interactions
### Details:
1. Create middleware to intercept and log all incoming HTTP requests with method, path, headers
2. Extend middleware to log response status codes, sizes, and timing information
3. Implement performance timing for API endpoints using decorators or middleware
4. Create specific instrumentation for LLM API calls to track tokens, latency, and costs
5. Develop metrics collection for database queries and other external service calls
6. Store performance metrics in a time-series format suitable for analysis
7. Test middleware with various API endpoints to ensure proper data collection
8. Ensure sensitive data is properly redacted from logs

## 3. Implement error tracking and alerting system [done]
### Dependencies: 8.1, 8.2
### Description: Create a comprehensive error tracking system with alerting capabilities for critical issues
### Details:
1. Implement global exception handlers to catch and log all unhandled exceptions
2. Create error categorization system to distinguish between different error types
3. Develop severity classification for errors (critical, major, minor)
4. Implement error aggregation to group similar errors
5. Create alerting system for critical errors via email, Slack, or other channels
6. Set up rate limiting for alerts to prevent alert fatigue
7. Implement error dashboards for monitoring error trends
8. Create automated tests to verify error capturing and alerting functionality
9. Document error handling procedures for the operations team

## 4. Develop usage analytics and cost tracking dashboards [done]
### Dependencies: 8.2, 8.3
### Description: Create comprehensive dashboards for monitoring system usage, performance metrics, and LLM API costs
### Details:
1. Select and integrate a visualization library or tool (e.g., Grafana, Metabase)
2. Design dashboard layouts for different user roles (developers, operations, management)
3. Create visualizations for API usage patterns and performance metrics
4. Implement specific dashboards for LLM usage showing tokens consumed, costs, and performance
5. Develop user activity dashboards showing active users and feature usage
6. Create cost tracking visualizations with trends and projections
7. Implement automated reports for regular distribution
8. Set up dashboard access controls based on user roles
9. Test dashboards with real and simulated data to ensure accuracy

## 5. Implement distributed tracing and log management [done]
### Dependencies: 8.1, 8.2, 8.3
### Description: Set up distributed tracing for request flows across services and implement log rotation, archiving, and audit logging
### Details:
1. Integrate a distributed tracing library (e.g., OpenTelemetry, Jaeger)
2. Implement trace context propagation across service boundaries
3. Create span recording for critical operations within services
4. Set up visualization for distributed traces
5. Implement log rotation and archiving policies based on size and age
6. Create audit logging for security-relevant events with tamper-evident storage
7. Develop log search and analysis capabilities
8. Implement log retention policies compliant with regulatory requirements
9. Create comprehensive tests for the entire monitoring and logging system
10. Document the monitoring and logging architecture for maintenance and onboarding
