3. Configure Swagger to generate documentation from annotations
4. Set up a documentation endpoint (e.g., /api/docs) to serve the Swagger UI
5. Ensure all API endpoints, request/response models, and authentication requirements are properly documented
6. Test that documentation is generated correctly and is accessible
7. Implement versioning strategy for the API documentation

## 2. Create architecture diagrams and component descriptions [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop comprehensive architecture diagrams showing system components, their relationships, and data flows. Include detailed descriptions of each component's purpose and functionality.
### Details:
1. Identify all major system components and their interactions
2. Create high-level system architecture diagram using a tool like Draw.io or Lucidchart
3. Develop detailed component diagrams for each major subsystem
4. Document data flow between components
5. Create database schema diagrams
6. Write detailed descriptions for each component including purpose, functionality, and technical specifications
7. Review diagrams with the development team for accuracy
8. Export diagrams in appropriate formats (PNG, SVG, PDF) for inclusion in documentation

## 3. Develop deployment guides for different environments [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.2
### Description: Create step-by-step deployment guides for development, staging, and production environments, including system requirements, configuration, and troubleshooting information.
### Details:
1. Document system requirements for each environment (hardware, software, network)
2. Create step-by-step installation procedures for each environment
3. Document configuration settings and environment variables
4. Create database setup and migration guides
5. Document CI/CD pipeline setup and configuration
6. Develop troubleshooting guides for common deployment issues
