# Task ID: 5
# Title: Create centralized orchestrator for agent routing
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop a system to route user requests to the appropriate specialized agent based on the content and intent of the request.
# Details:
Implement a request classifier using LLM to determine request type. Create a routing mechanism to direct requests to appropriate agents. Develop a plugin architecture for registering and discovering agents. Implement fallback mechanisms for ambiguous requests. Create a central API endpoint for receiving all user queries. Develop a response formatter for standardizing agent outputs. Implement chain-of-thought routing for complex queries that may require multiple agents. Ensure comprehensive unit testing for all orchestrator components.

# Test Strategy:
Implement comprehensive unit tests for all orchestrator components including request classification, agent routing, inter-agent communication, and response formatting. Test routing accuracy with various request types. Verify correct agent selection. Test fallback mechanisms for ambiguous requests and low confidence classifications. Validate plugin discovery system. Test error handling during agent communication. Conduct integration tests with mock agents. Perform performance tests for the orchestration process under various load conditions.
