# Task ID: 1
# Title: Set up project structure and infrastructure
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize the project with proper directory structure, dependencies, and configuration for a FastAPI application with Docker support, with comprehensive testing infrastructure.
# Details:
Create a new Python project with FastAPI framework. Set up the directory structure following best practices (app/, tests/, docs/). Initialize requirements.txt with FastAPI, Uvicorn, Pydantic, and other core dependencies. Create a Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml for containerization. Set up configuration management using environment variables with python-dotenv. Initialize Git repository with appropriate .gitignore file. Set up GitHub Actions workflow for CI/CD. Implement comprehensive testing infrastructure with pytest, including fixtures, mocks, and test coverage reporting. Ensure each component has corresponding unit tests.

# Test Strategy:
Implement a comprehensive testing approach including: 1) Unit tests for all components and utility functions using pytest, 2) Integration tests for API endpoints to verify correct behavior, 3) Configuration validation tests to ensure proper loading of environment variables, 4) Test coverage reporting to maintain high code coverage, 5) Verify that the application can be built and run in Docker, 6) Ensure all dependencies are correctly installed, 7) Validate that the basic FastAPI server starts without errors.

4. Set up the main router in app/api/__init__.py
5. Implement a health check endpoint at /health that returns service status
6. Update main.py to include the API routers
7. Add OpenAPI documentation configuration
8. Testing approach: Write tests for the health check endpoint to verify it returns the correct status

## 5. Set up Git repository and CI/CD workflow [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.6
### Description: Initialize Git repository with appropriate configuration and set up GitHub Actions for CI/CD
### Details:
1. Initialize Git repository with `git init`
2. Create a comprehensive .gitignore file (include Python, IDE, and environment-specific files)
3. Create .github/workflows/ directory
4. Create a CI workflow YAML file with:
   - Linting checks (flake8, black, isort)
   - Running tests with pytest
   - Generating and reporting test coverage
   - Building Docker image
5. Add pre-commit hooks configuration
6. Create a README.md with project description, setup instructions, and development guidelines
7. Make initial commit with all the project structure
