3. Develop a prompt template system with standardized, efficient formats
4. Implement context windowing to limit token usage in long conversations
5. Create a token usage tracking system by request and user
6. Develop model fallback strategies (route simpler queries to smaller models)
7. Implement prompt caching for identical or similar requests
8. Document best practices for prompt engineering

Testing approach:
- Measure token reduction and response quality for optimized prompts
- Compare cost metrics before and after optimization
- Validate that response quality remains acceptable with compressed prompts
- Test fallback strategies under various scenarios

## 4. Implement asynchronous processing and batch operations [done]
### Dependencies: 13.1, 13.2
### Description: Redesign appropriate workflows to use asynchronous processing and batch operations for improved throughput and resource utilization

2. Implement a message queue system (RabbitMQ, Kafka, or cloud-native alternatives)
3. Develop worker processes to handle asynchronous tasks
4. Create batch processing capabilities for aggregated operations
5. Implement retry mechanisms and dead-letter queues for failed operations
6. Develop monitoring for queue depths and processing times
7. Add user feedback mechanisms for long-running operations
8. Document the asynchronous architecture and batch processing workflows

Testing approach:
