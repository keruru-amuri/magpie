# Task ID: 2
# Title: Implement database and caching infrastructure
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up PostgreSQL with Supabase for data storage and Redis for caching with appropriate schemas and connection management.
# Details:
Configure PostgreSQL connection using Supabase client. Create database schemas for users, conversation history, and agent configurations. Implement database migration system using Alembic. Set up Redis connection for caching LLM responses and conversation contexts. Create database models using SQLAlchemy ORM. Implement repository pattern for data access. Add connection pooling for optimal performance. Include health checks for database and Redis connections.

# Test Strategy:
Write unit tests for database models and repositories. Verify connection to both PostgreSQL and Redis. Test migration scripts. Ensure proper error handling for connection failures.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Configure PostgreSQL connection with Supabase client [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up the connection to PostgreSQL using Supabase client with proper configuration, environment variables, and connection pooling
### Details:
1. Install required packages: supabase-py, python-dotenv, sqlalchemy
2. Create environment variables for Supabase URL, API key, and database credentials
3. Implement a connection factory class to manage database connections
4. Configure connection pooling parameters (pool size, timeout, max overflow)
5. Implement a health check method to verify database connectivity
6. Create a connection context manager for safe resource handling
7. Test connection by executing a simple query
8. Document the connection setup process
9. Testing approach: Write unit tests using a test database to verify connection establishment, pooling behavior, and error handling

## 2. Create database schemas and implement migration system [done]
### Dependencies: 2.1
### Description: Design and implement database schemas for users, conversation history, and agent configurations, and set up Alembic for database migrations
### Details:
1. Install Alembic for database migrations
2. Define SQLAlchemy models for users, conversation history, and agent configurations
3. Create schema definitions with appropriate relationships and constraints
4. Set up Alembic migration environment
5. Create initial migration script to establish the base schema
6. Implement upgrade and downgrade paths for each migration
7. Test migration process in development environment
8. Document schema design and migration workflow
9. Testing approach: Create test migrations and verify they apply correctly, test rollback functionality, validate that schemas match expected structure

## 3. Implement Redis caching infrastructure [done]
### Dependencies: 2.1
### Description: Set up Redis connection and implement caching mechanisms for LLM responses and conversation contexts
### Details:
1. Install required packages: redis, aioredis (for async support)
2. Configure Redis connection with appropriate environment variables
3. Implement a Redis connection manager with connection pooling
4. Create cache key generation strategies for different data types
5. Develop cache serialization/deserialization methods for complex objects
6. Implement TTL (time-to-live) policies for different cached data types
7. Create health check functionality for Redis connection
8. Add logging for cache hits/misses
9. Testing approach: Write unit tests to verify caching behavior, test cache invalidation, measure performance improvements with caching

## 4. Develop repository pattern for data access [done]
### Dependencies: 2.2, 2.3
### Description: Implement repository classes for each entity to abstract database operations and provide a clean interface for data access
### Details:
1. Design repository interfaces for each entity (users, conversations, agent configurations)
2. Implement concrete repository classes using SQLAlchemy ORM
3. Add CRUD operations for each entity
4. Implement query methods with filtering, sorting, and pagination
5. Integrate caching in repositories for frequently accessed data
6. Add transaction support for operations that modify multiple entities
7. Implement error handling and retry logic
8. Create factory methods for repository instantiation
9. Testing approach: Write unit tests for each repository method, test transaction handling, verify cache integration works correctly

## 5. Implement comprehensive testing for database and caching components [done]
### Dependencies: 2.2, 2.3, 2.4
### Description: Create a test suite for database and caching infrastructure with unit tests, integration tests, and performance benchmarks
### Details:
1. Set up test database configuration with isolated test data
2. Create fixtures for database and Redis testing
3. Implement unit tests for all database models and repositories
4. Add integration tests for database and cache interactions
5. Create performance benchmarks for database operations with and without caching
6. Implement load tests to verify connection pooling behavior
7. Add tests for error conditions and recovery scenarios
8. Create CI pipeline configuration for database tests
9. Testing approach: Use pytest for test implementation, create mock objects where appropriate, use database transactions to isolate tests, measure and assert on performance metrics
