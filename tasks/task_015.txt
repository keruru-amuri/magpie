# Task ID: 15
# Title: Prepare system for production deployment
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 13, 14
# Priority: low
# Description: Finalize all components, configurations, and processes needed for production deployment and handoff.
# Details:
Create production deployment scripts and configurations. Implement security hardening measures. Develop backup and disaster recovery procedures. Create monitoring and alerting setup. Implement data retention and privacy policies. Develop user training materials. Create system handoff documentation. Implement production environment validation tests. Develop rollback procedures for deployments.

# Test Strategy:
Perform end-to-end testing in staging environment. Verify security measures with penetration testing. Test backup and recovery procedures. Validate monitoring and alerting functionality. Conduct user acceptance testing.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Production Deployment Scripts and Configuration [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop automated scripts and configuration files for deploying the system to production environments with minimal manual intervention.
### Details:
Implementation details:
1. Create infrastructure-as-code templates (e.g., Terraform, CloudFormation) for provisioning production resources
2. Develop deployment scripts using appropriate tools (e.g., Ansible, Chef, or custom bash/PowerShell scripts)
3. Configure environment-specific variables and settings
4. Implement database migration scripts with rollback capabilities
5. Document the deployment process with step-by-step instructions
6. Testing approach: Perform dry-run deployments in staging environment that mirrors production, validate all components deploy correctly, and verify rollback procedures work as expected.

## 2. Implement Security Hardening Measures [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.1
### Description: Apply security best practices and hardening techniques to protect the system from vulnerabilities and unauthorized access in production.
### Details:
Implementation details:
1. Configure firewall rules and network security groups to restrict access
2. Implement encryption for data at rest and in transit
3. Set up secure authentication mechanisms and proper role-based access controls
4. Apply security patches and updates to all system components
5. Conduct security scanning and vulnerability assessment
6. Implement intrusion detection/prevention systems
7. Configure secure headers, CORS policies, and other web security measures
8. Testing approach: Perform security penetration testing, run automated vulnerability scanners, and conduct a security audit against compliance requirements.

## 3. Develop Backup and Disaster Recovery Procedures [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.1, 15.2
### Description: Create comprehensive backup strategies and disaster recovery plans to ensure business continuity in case of system failures.
### Details:
Implementation details:
1. Define backup schedules and retention policies for different data types
2. Implement automated backup scripts for databases, file storage, and configuration
3. Set up off-site backup storage and encryption of backup data
4. Create disaster recovery runbooks with detailed recovery steps
5. Develop system restoration procedures from backups
6. Document recovery time objectives (RTO) and recovery point objectives (RPO)
7. Testing approach: Perform test restores from backups in isolated environments, conduct disaster recovery drills, and validate that recovery procedures meet the defined RTO/RPO.

## 4. Set Up Monitoring and Alerting System [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.1, 15.2
### Description: Implement comprehensive monitoring and alerting solutions to track system health, performance, and detect issues proactively.
### Details:
Implementation details:
1. Deploy monitoring agents and collectors across all system components
2. Configure performance metrics collection for servers, databases, and applications
3. Set up log aggregation and analysis tools
4. Create dashboards for visualizing system health and performance
5. Configure alerting thresholds and notification channels (email, SMS, chat integrations)
6. Implement automated incident response procedures for critical alerts
7. Set up uptime and synthetic transaction monitoring
8. Testing approach: Simulate various failure scenarios to verify alerts trigger properly, validate that dashboards display accurate information, and ensure the monitoring system itself is resilient.

## 5. Conduct Production Readiness Testing and Documentation [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.1, 15.2, 15.3, 15.4
### Description: Perform comprehensive testing to validate production readiness and create detailed documentation for system handoff.
### Details:
Implementation details:
1. Develop and execute production validation test plans
2. Perform load testing to validate system performance under expected production loads
3. Create user training materials including guides, videos, and reference documentation
4. Develop comprehensive system handoff documentation covering architecture, operations, and maintenance
5. Document data retention and privacy policies in compliance with relevant regulations
6. Create rollback procedures for failed deployments
7. Conduct a final security review and compliance check
8. Testing approach: Perform end-to-end testing in a production-like environment, conduct user acceptance testing with stakeholders, and validate all documentation for completeness and accuracy through peer review.
