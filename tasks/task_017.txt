   - Check that edge cases and special scenarios are represented
   - Ensure sufficient volume of data for performance testing

3. API/Utility Function Tests:
   - Create unit tests for all data access and manipulation functions
   - Test data loading utilities with various input conditions
   - Verify caching mechanisms work as expected

4. Integration Tests:
   - Test each agent use case with the mock data
   - Verify the Technical Documentation Assistant can retrieve and use documentation
   - Ensure Troubleshooting Advisor can access problem/solution pairs
   - Test Maintenance Procedure Generator with mock maintenance procedures

5. Performance Tests:
   - Measure data loading and retrieval times
   - Test system behavior with maximum expected data volumes
   - Verify memory usage remains within acceptable limits

6. Toggle Tests:
   - Verify system can switch between mock and real data sources
   - Test configuration options for controlling mock data behavior

Create a test report documenting coverage and results for all test categories.
