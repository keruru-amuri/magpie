# Task ID: 12
# Title: Implement comprehensive testing framework
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 9, 10, 11
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop a robust testing system for evaluating agent responses, performance, and overall system functionality.
# Details:
Create a test case generator for different agent scenarios. Implement automated testing for agent responses. Develop integration tests for the orchestrator. Create performance benchmarks for different model sizes. Implement response quality evaluation metrics. Develop user feedback simulation. Create regression test suite. Implement continuous testing in CI/CD pipeline. Develop test data management system.

# Test Strategy:
Verify test coverage across all agents. Test accuracy of quality evaluation metrics. Validate performance benchmark consistency. Test regression detection capability. Measure testing system overhead.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement unit testing framework with test case generator [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop a unit testing framework that includes automated test case generation for different agent scenarios and responses
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Set up a testing directory structure with separate folders for unit tests, test data, and test utilities
2. Create a test case generator that can produce varied agent scenarios based on configurable parameters (e.g., query complexity, expected response types)
3. Implement test fixtures and mocks for agent dependencies
4. Develop assertion utilities specifically for validating agent responses
5. Create helper functions to simulate different user inputs and contexts
6. Add documentation for how to write and execute unit tests

Testing approach:
- Verify test case generator produces valid test cases with appropriate variety
- Ensure unit tests can be run in isolation
- Check code coverage metrics for the testing framework itself

## 2. Develop integration testing framework for system components [done]
### Dependencies: 12.1
### Description: Create an integration testing framework to test interactions between the agent, orchestrator, and other system components
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Set up integration test environment configuration with ability to use either mocked or actual dependencies
2. Implement test harnesses for the orchestrator that can track component interactions
3. Create integration test scenarios that verify end-to-end workflows
4. Develop utilities to reset system state between tests
5. Implement logging and debugging tools for integration test failures
6. Create integration test runners that can execute tests in parallel where appropriate

Testing approach:
- Verify that integration tests correctly identify issues in component interactions
- Test with both mocked and actual dependencies to ensure consistency
- Check that test environment properly isolates tests from production systems

## 3. Implement performance testing and benchmarking system [done]
### Dependencies: 12.1, 12.2
### Description: Develop a performance testing framework that can benchmark different model sizes, response times, and system throughput
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Create performance test harnesses that can measure response times, throughput, and resource usage
2. Implement benchmark scenarios for different model sizes and configurations
3. Develop load testing capabilities to simulate concurrent users
4. Create visualization tools for performance metrics
5. Implement performance regression detection
6. Set up baseline performance metrics for different deployment configurations

Testing approach:
- Verify benchmark consistency across multiple runs
- Test performance under various load conditions
- Ensure metrics collection has minimal impact on the performance being measured

## 4. Create response quality evaluation and user feedback simulation [done]
### Dependencies: 12.1, 12.2
### Description: Develop a framework for evaluating response quality and simulating user feedback for continuous improvement
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Implement response quality metrics (relevance, accuracy, helpfulness, etc.)
2. Create a reference dataset of ideal responses for comparison
3. Develop automated evaluation pipelines for response quality
4. Implement user feedback simulation that can generate realistic feedback patterns
5. Create tools to aggregate and analyze quality metrics over time
6. Develop regression testing for response quality

Testing approach:
- Validate quality metrics against human evaluations
- Test feedback simulation against real user feedback patterns
- Verify that the evaluation system can detect intentionally degraded responses

## 5. Implement CI/CD integration and test data management [done]
### Dependencies: 12.1, 12.2, 12.3, 12.4
### Description: Set up continuous testing in the CI/CD pipeline and develop a comprehensive test data management system
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Configure CI/CD pipeline integration for all test types (unit, integration, performance, security)
2. Implement test selection strategies to optimize CI/CD runtime
3. Create a test data management system with versioning and access controls
4. Develop synthetic test data generation for sensitive scenarios
5. Implement test result reporting and alerting
6. Create security testing automation focusing on data handling and access controls
7. Develop user acceptance testing frameworks with scenario templates

Testing approach:
- Verify CI/CD integration by introducing intentional test failures
- Test data management system should be tested for data integrity and access controls
- Validate that security tests can detect common vulnerabilities
