# Task ID: 7
# Title: Develop model selection system
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 4, 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create an intelligent system to select the appropriate LLM model based on task complexity, cost considerations, and performance requirements.
# Details:
Implement a model selection algorithm based on request complexity. Create a configuration system for model capabilities and costs. Develop a model performance tracking system. Implement adaptive selection based on historical performance. Create fallback mechanisms for model unavailability. Develop a cost estimation system for different models. Implement model-specific prompt optimization. Create a model capability registry.

# Test Strategy:
Test model selection accuracy for different request types. Verify cost optimization effectiveness. Test fallback mechanisms. Validate performance tracking accuracy. Measure response time improvements from appropriate model selection.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement task complexity analysis system [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop a system to analyze incoming requests and determine their complexity level to inform model selection.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Define complexity metrics (token count, required reasoning, specialized knowledge needs, etc.)
2. Create scoring functions for each complexity dimension
3. Implement a composite complexity score calculator
4. Add configurable thresholds for complexity levels (e.g., simple, medium, complex)
5. Build unit tests with sample requests of varying complexity
6. Develop a simple API that accepts a request and returns a complexity score and classification

Testing approach:
- Create test cases with pre-scored requests
- Validate that complexity scores are consistent and properly categorized
- Test edge cases (very simple/complex requests)
- Benchmark performance to ensure analysis doesn't add significant latency

## 2. Create model registry and configuration system [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Build a registry to store and manage information about available LLM models, their capabilities, constraints, and costs.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Design a data structure to represent model capabilities (context length, specialized skills, etc.)
2. Implement cost representation (per token, per request, etc.)
3. Create a model registry class to store and retrieve model information
4. Develop configuration loading from file/database
5. Implement CRUD operations for model configurations
6. Add validation for model configuration entries
7. Create a capability matching system to filter models by required capabilities

Testing approach:
- Test configuration loading from various sources
- Verify CRUD operations work correctly
- Test capability matching with different requirement sets
- Ensure invalid configurations are properly rejected

## 3. Develop cost optimization and selection algorithm [done]
### Dependencies: 7.1, 7.2
### Description: Create the core algorithm that selects the most appropriate model based on task complexity, cost considerations, and capability requirements.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Implement a selection algorithm that takes complexity score (from subtask 1) and matches to appropriate models (from subtask 2)
2. Create cost estimation functions for different request types
3. Develop optimization logic that balances performance needs vs. cost
4. Implement fallback chains for when preferred models are unavailable
5. Add configuration options for cost-performance balance preferences
6. Create a simple API that accepts a request and returns the selected model

Testing approach:
- Test with various complexity scores and verify appropriate models are selected
- Test cost optimization with different budget constraints
- Verify fallback chains work correctly when primary models are unavailable
- Test with edge cases (no suitable model, all models unavailable)

## 4. Implement performance tracking and adaptive selection [done]
### Dependencies: 7.2, 7.3
### Description: Build a system to track model performance over time and adaptively improve selection based on historical performance data.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Design a performance metrics data structure (latency, success rate, quality scores)
2. Implement a performance logging system for model usage
3. Create an analytics module to process historical performance data
4. Develop adaptive selection logic that incorporates historical performance
5. Implement model-specific prompt optimization based on past performance
6. Add A/B testing capability to evaluate selection algorithm changes
7. Create performance dashboards or reporting functions

Testing approach:
- Test logging system with simulated model responses
- Verify analytics correctly aggregate and interpret performance data
- Test adaptive selection with mock historical data
- Ensure system properly handles performance degradation scenarios

## 5. Create comprehensive testing and integration system [done]
### Dependencies: 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4
### Description: Develop end-to-end testing for the model selection system and integrate all components into a cohesive system.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Create integration tests that verify all components work together
2. Implement system-level tests with realistic request scenarios
3. Develop load testing to ensure performance under high volume
4. Create a comprehensive API for the entire model selection system
5. Implement proper error handling and logging throughout the system
6. Add configuration validation and system health checks
7. Create documentation for the system API and configuration options

Testing approach:
- End-to-end tests with realistic request flows
- Stress testing to identify breaking points
- Performance benchmarking to establish baselines
- Failure scenario testing (network issues, model unavailability)
- Regression testing suite to prevent future regressions
