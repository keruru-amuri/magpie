### Dependencies: None
### Description: Fix the test infrastructure for authentication and authorization tests. This includes setting up proper database mocking, configuring Redis for the test environment, and ensuring all integration tests pass.
### Details:
This subtask addresses the issues with the integration tests for the authentication and authorization system. The current implementation has passing unit tests but failing integration tests due to infrastructure issues.

Tasks to complete:
1. Fix the database setup in the test environment
2. Configure Redis for the test environment or create a mock Redis implementation
3. Set up proper mock data for testing
4. Ensure all integration tests pass

The main issues to address are:
- Redis connection errors in the test environment
- Database setup and configuration
- Mock data for testing

This subtask is necessary to ensure the authentication and authorization system is fully tested and working correctly.
<info added on 2025-05-04T12:38:36.121Z>
This subtask addresses the issues with the integration tests for the authentication and authorization system by implementing in-memory solutions for external dependencies. The current implementation will be modified to use self-contained test environments.

Key updates:
1. **SQLite In-Memory Database**: Configure Django test settings to use SQLite in-memory database for all database operations, replacing production database configurations during testing
2. **In-Memory Redis Mock**: Implement a lightweight Redis mock using Python's built-in dict or libraries like fakeredis for caching tests, eliminating external Redis dependencies
3. **Dependency Mocking Strategy**:
   - Use unittest.mock.patch for external API calls
   - Create service layer mocks for third-party authentication providers
   - Implement in-memory email backend for verification testing
4. **Test Environment Isolation**:
   - Ensure complete environment separation using pytest fixtures
   - Implement automatic cleanup of in-memory stores between tests
   - Configure test doubles for all external services

Required changes to existing tests:
- Update test cases to use in-memory database backend
- Replace Redis client references with mock implementations
- Modify integration tests to verify behavior against mocked services
- Add cleanup routines to ensure test independence

## 7. Implement Test Infrastructure for Orchestrator Component [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the necessary test infrastructure to support integration tests for the orchestrator component, focusing on database mocking, external service mocking, and repository interface consistency.
### Details:
This subtask addresses the critical test infrastructure needs for the orchestrator component integration tests. The current implementation has passing unit tests but failing integration tests due to infrastructure issues.

Tasks to complete:
1. Create a test configuration module that sets up all necessary mocks and test databases
2. Implement in-memory database setup for tests using SQLite
3. Create a mock LLM service for Azure OpenAI API calls
4. Fix repository interfaces to ensure consistency (e.g., add missing methods like `delete_conversation`)
5. Update integration tests to use the mocks
6. Ensure all orchestrator integration tests pass

Implementation details:
1. Create a `test_config.py` module with functions for setting up test dependencies
2. Implement an in-memory SQLite database for testing:
   ```python

   TEST_DATABASE_URL = "sqlite:///:memory:"
   test_engine = create_engine(TEST_DATABASE_URL)
   TestSessionLocal = sessionmaker(autocommit=False, autoflush=False, bind=test_engine)
   ```
3. Create a mock LLM service for Azure OpenAI:
   ```python
   class MockLLMService:
       async def generate_chat_completion(self, messages, model=None, temperature=None, max_tokens=None):
           # Return a predefined response for testing
           return {
               "choices": [
                   {
                       "message": {
                           "role": "assistant",
                           "content": "This is a mock response for testing"
                       }
                   }
               ]
           }
       
       async def classify_request(self, query, options):
           # Return a predefined classification for testing
           return {
               "agent_type": "documentation",
               "confidence": 0.9,
               "reasoning": "This is a mock classification for testing"
           }
   ```
4. Update the ConversationRepository to include missing methods:
   ```python
   def delete_conversation(self, conversation_id: str) -> bool:
       """
       Delete a conversation and all its messages.
       
       Args:
           conversation_id: Conversation ID
           
       Returns:
           bool: True if the conversation was deleted, False if not found
       """
       # Implementation here
   ```
5. Create test fixtures for common test scenarios
