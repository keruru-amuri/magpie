## Recommendations

Based on the test results, the following recommendations are made:

1. **Improve Code Coverage**: Add tests for error handling paths to improve overall code coverage.
2. **Optimize Performance**: Further optimize the performance of the maintenance procedure generation, which has the highest average time.
3. **Enhance Documentation**: Add more examples and use cases to the documentation.
4. **Add More Edge Cases**: Include more edge cases in the mock data to cover additional scenarios.
5. **Implement Monitoring**: Add monitoring for the mock data infrastructure to track usage and performance.

## Conclusion

The mock data infrastructure for the MAGPIE platform has been thoroughly tested and meets all requirements. It provides a solid foundation for development and testing of the platform's three primary agent use cases: Technical Documentation Assistant, Troubleshooting Advisor, and Maintenance Procedure Generator.

The infrastructure is flexible, configurable, and performs well under expected load. It can be easily extended to support additional use cases and data types in the future.
